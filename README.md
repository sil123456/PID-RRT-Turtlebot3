# PID controler + RRT for Turtlebot3
### This project is an integration of PID control and the RRT algorithm to implement a full path planning stack for the TurtleBot3 in the Gazebo simulation environment.
The robot is able to move from the current coordinate to a new coordinate based on user input, with goal x, y, theta, and mode of PID, following the path generated by the RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) 
searching algorithm. The process can be executed repeatedly.

One has the option to run this code in real-life or in a Gazebo simulation. Either way, it is accompanied by an RViz visualization.

# extra work
### The TurtleBot can also follow a configurable figure 8 trajectory.
